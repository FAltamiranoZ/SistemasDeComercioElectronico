1) Creating and Running an Application Client on the GlassFish Server

This tutorial shows how to create a simple application client and access an Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) deployed to GlassFish server 3. In this tutorial you will first create an enterprise applications that contains a simple session bean and a Java class library project that contains a remote interface for the session bean. You will then create an application client that accesses the session bean through the remote interface in the class library. The class library JAR that contains the remote interface is added to the classpath of the enterprise application and the application client.

2) Getting Started with Java EE Applications

This document provides a brief introduction to some of the features introduced as part of Java Enterprise Edition 6 (Java EE 6) specification. To illustrate the new features, this tutorial will demonstrate how to create a simple Java EE web application that contains an EJB 3.1 stateless session bean facade for an entity class. You will use wizards in the IDE to generate the entity class and the session bean. The code generated by the wizard uses queries that are defined in the Criteria API that is part of JPA 2.x and contained in the Java EE 6 specification. You will then create a named managed bean that accesses the session facade and a presentation layer that uses the Facelets view framework as specified in JSF 2.x.

3) Creating an Enterprise Application with EJB 3.1

This tutorial takes you through the basics of developing a Java EE 6 enterprise application and demonstrates some of the EJB 3.1 technology features that were introduced as part of the Java EE 6 specification. In this tutorial you will create an enterprise application that enables a user to post to and retrieve messages from a database.

The application contains an EJB module and a web module. The EJB module contains an entity class, a session facade for the entity class and a message-driven bean. The web module contains servlets for displaying and posting messages and a singleton session bean that counts the number of users in the session.

Before starting this tutorial you may want to familiarize yourself with the following document.

4) NetBeans Platform CRUD Application Tutorial

This tutorial shows you how to integrate a Java DB database into a NetBeans Platform application. We start by exploring a Java DB database, from which we create entity classes. Though the starting point of this tutorial is Java DB, be aware that these instructions are not applicable to Java DB only. Rather, they are relevant to any relational database supported by NetBeans IDE.

Though the database access part of this tutorial is fine for smaller applications, there are many other factors to be aware of in the context of larger real-life scenarios. It is important to be aware of these factors, aspects of which are described here.

Once we have code for accessing the database, we wrap the entity classes into a module, together with modules for the related JPA JARS. Once the data access module is part of our application, we create a new module that provides the user interface for our application. The new module gives the user a tree hierarchy showing data from the database. We then create another module that lets the user edit the data displayed by the first module. By separating the viewer from the editor in distinct modules, we will enable the user to install a different editor for the same viewer, since different editors could be created by external vendors, some commercially and some for free. It is this flexibility that the modular architecture of the NetBeans Platform makes possible.

Once we have an editor, we begin adding CRUD functionality. First, the "R", standing for "Read", is handled by the viewer described above. Next, the "U" for "Update" is handled, followed by the "C" for "Create", and the "D" for "Delete".

At the end of the tutorial, you will have learned about a range of NetBeans Platform features that help you in creating applications of this kind. For example, you will have learned about the UndoRedo.Manager and the ExplorerManager, as well as NetBeans Platform Swing components, such as TopComponent and BeanTreeView.

Note: This document uses NetBeans IDE 8.0 and NetBeans Platform 8.0. If you are using an earlier version, see the previous version of this document. A prerequisite for following this tutorial is that you have already completed and understood the NetBeans Platform Quick Start, while NetBeans Platform for Beginners (published in 2014) is very highly recommended.
